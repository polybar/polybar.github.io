## Another Year, Another Release

It has been slightly longer than a year though.
Version [3.5.0][post-3.5.0] came out almost 15 months ago, but we did get quite a
few things done in that time.

But first, as usual, a few statistics:

* **40** contributors (**30** first-time)
* **136** pull-requests
* **278** commits
* **283** files changed
* **11556** lines added
* **10360** lines deleted
* **54** issues closed
* **18** bugs fixed

### What's New?

Again, I spent a lot of time improving the internals.
Here, I want to highlight some of the user-facing changes though.

Polybar finally has a default configuration file:

![default config screenshot](/assets/img/default-config.png)

For the longest time, polybar shipped an example config file.
The intention was that it would serve as an example of what kind of
configuration is possible in polybar, it was not supposed to work
out-of-the-box for everyone.
The new default config aims to work for everyone.
That's why it only includes modules that work on (almost) every machine without
hardware or software specific configuration.

Polybar installations should also now install this default config to
`/etc/polybar/config.ini` from where polybar will also try to load it if it
can't find one in your home directory.
So new users, after a successful installation, should be able to simply run
`polybar` (without any additional arguments) and get a working bar.

Individual modules can now be dynamically hidden using
[actions][visibility-actions].
For example, to toggle a module called `wireless`, you could use the following
command:

```bash
polybar-msg action wireless module_toggle
```

Modules can also be started in the hidden state by setting the `hidden` setting
to `true`.
If a module is hidden, it is still running in the background.

Polybar now supports the "point" unit (`pt`) for specifying sizes, margin,
padding, and spacing.
A point 1/72 inches and its size in pixels is determined using the
DPI setting configured in polybar.
This should finally make it easier to create configs that work on multiple
screen sizes and still look good.
In addition, margin, padding, and spacing can be specified in pixels (`px`) as
well.
Read the [formatting wiki][wiki-formatting] for the full documentation of this
feature.

Some other smaller notable changes include proper support for relative paths in
`include-directory` and `include-file`, different weights for ramp levels,
network interface detection, warn formats for some modules, and many more.
You can see the full changelog on the [release page][tag-3.6.0].

### Migration Guide

Not too many features have been deprecated in this release.
But it's best to update your config to no longer use any deprecated features.

In the `[settings]` section, the options `throttle-output` and
`throttle-output-for` are no longer used and can be removed from your config.

Rename your config file from `config` to `config.ini`.
Polybar now also looks for `config.ini` by default and with the `.ini`
extension, many editors can also provide the correct syntax highlighting.

If you are using polybar's inter-process-messaging (IPC) feature and are
directly writing to `/tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID>`, migrate those scripts over to
using the `polybar-msg` program.

In addition if you are using the IPC `hook` message type to control the IPC
module, use the new [module actions][ipc-actions] instead.
The `polybar-msg` utility will tell you the correct command to use instead.

As always, deprecated features will continue to work but will be removed in the
future and produce warning messages whenever you use them, so check your
polybar logs.

### Next Steps

For the next, we will focus on three main topics:

* Fixing most of the tray issues involving it appearing below the bar or above
fullscreen windows.
* A new font rendering engine based on Pango for better support of font
features.
* The ability to use config references together with other text inside config
values.

The [milestone][milestone-3.7.0] for 3.7.0 includes a bunch more things we want
to work on but these three are the ones I definitely want to see in the next
release.

You can get the release tarball for this release on the [release
page][tag-3.6.0] if you want to build from source and hopefully this new
release makes its way into your distro's package repos soon.
