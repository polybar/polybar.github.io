title: Freenode is dead, long live Libera.Chat!
excerpt: The new polybar IRC channel is now on libera.chat

## What happened?

Something akin to a hostile takeover happened a month or so ago on the freenode
IRC network, which led to many of the staffers resigning.
[Ars Technica][1] has a good summary of events and I'll link to the resignation
letter of one of the staffers [here][2] which also links to the letters of
other staffers.

At that point I already started considering moving our polybar IRC channel to
another network.

Yesterday, freenode apparently decided to drop all existing channel and
nickname registrations and I effectively lost control of the `#polybar`
channel.
I could probably get it back by going through the registration process again,
but I don't think polybar has any future on the freenode network (and neither
does freenode itself).

## A New Home

The official `#polybar` IRC channel now lives on [libera.chat:6697][3], a new
network created by old freenode staffers on a more stable legal footing.
Learn how to connect to the network [here][4].

While the `#polybar` channel on freenode technically still exists because there
are users in it, it is no longer an official channel and we encourage you to
disconnect.
No polybar team member will be present in any freenode polybar channel in the future.
